					<p>
						Iâ€™m currently a BBA student at ESSEC. Iâ€™ve lived in Paris and in OrlÃ©ans. Iâ€™ve had the chance to travel to more than 20 countries in all 5 continents and it made me the open-minded person that I am today.

				<h2><strong>Horse Riding</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I like doing horse riding as I have been riding since I was three years old. I even had a unique experience driving cattle for two weeks from California to Nevada. This practice allowed me to improve my communication and understanding with others as well as engaging in an outdoor sporting activity.

				<h2><strong>Reading</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I also like reading a lot. Itâ€™s the occasion for me to refocus on myself, put my imagination to work and learn new things in general. I particularly enjoy reading heroic fantasy and science fiction novels.

				<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I listen to a lot of music in my everyday life. I donâ€™t listen to a specific style of music since I link the songs to the moment I listen to them or the meaning of the lyrics. I especially enjoy artists like Lil Peep, Marcianeke and Chevy who all have drastically different musical styles. A good song with meaningful lyrics can make my day better and thatâ€™s what I like about music.
